// A binary tree is a special type of tree where every node has at most two children
//  For every node-
//      All values in the left subtree (LST) are smaller
//      All values in the right subtree (RST) must be greater
//  * Both LST and RST must also be Binary tree
// Inorder traversal of BST is always sorted
